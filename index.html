        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Mixed Melody, also known as Dani. I’m a detail-oriented problem solver with a background in customer support and a growing focus on technical and operational work. I enjoy building tools, writing clear documentation, and creating systems that help people and teams work more smoothly.

I have hands-on experience with Python and familiarity with Java, C++, and C#, and I’ve recently begun exploring AI tools and workflows through practical projects. I’m currently building this portfolio to demonstrate real, usable solutions as I transition toward remote support and tech-focused roles, ideally in environments that value people, learning, and thoughtful problem-solving.</p>
